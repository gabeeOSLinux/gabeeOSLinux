<p><strong>Pop Shell extension</strong> (Developer by Michael Murphy)</p>
<p><em><strong>Pop Shell</strong> pitches itself as a &ldquo;&hellip;keyboard-driven layer for GNOME Shell which allows for quick and sensible navigation and management of windows&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p><em>Or to put it another way it&rsquo;s i3-gaps, but for GNOME Shell, natively, with all the raw power that comes from that, namely fine-grained keyboard control PLUS all the niceties that of a full-bodied desktop environment too.</em> (Joey Sneddon)</p>
